		<p id="img-caption">In Spider-Man, Into the Spider-Verse, the camera is flipped during Miles’ leap
            of faith. This is to signify Miles’ ascension into his role as Spider-Man. He’s not just falling, 
            but rising to the occasion.

		<p>Did you ever think you could be Spider-Man? This gorgeous take on the Marvel superhero knows you can
            — that everyone can. The great power always comes by accident, that famous spider-bite origin story; 
            it’s what you do with that power, of course, that really counts.
        </p>
        <p>In this film, Spider-Man isn’t one particular person; <strong>it’s an idea accessible to anyone</strong>,
            no matter where they come from or what they look like. And it’s almost certainly no accident that the
            older multiverse Peter Parker who Miles teams up with — an out-of-shape, middle-aged white dude who’s 
            totally screwed up his own life, in spite of all the built-in advantages of being a superhero — ends up 
            learning quite a bit from Morales about how to repair his own life and respect other people.
